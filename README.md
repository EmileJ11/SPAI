## SETUP MEASUREMENTS
In the figure below is the measurement setup. Two speakers and a railway with a cart on it where the head and microphone array are placed upon are used for the measurements.
Speaker 1 is placed 0,5m away from the end of the railway, facing in the direction of the railway. Speaker 2 is positioned perpendicular to the railway. It is placed in the middle of the railway and 2m from it.<br />
During the first measurement the cart with the head and microphone array was placed on the discrete positions on the railway, indicated with numbers on the figure below. Each position is 20cm apart, therefore a small spatial resolution was obtained. To do this measurement, each speaker played an exponential sine sweep that was recorded by the microphone array for each position, so 2x12=24 measurements, during this the cart was standing still on the discrete position.<br />
For the continuous measurement, both the head and microphone array were used. In this case the cart was moving from position 1 to position 12 with a speed of 1km/h. During this measurement a sound was played by each speaker at a time, the head and microphone array were recording. Therefore four measurements were obtained.<br />
To clarify, the microphone array consisted of six microphones, in each direction one, so for each measurement of the microphone array, there are actually six measurements. The head consists of two microphones, one for the left and one for the right ear, so for every measurement for the head, there are actually two measurements.<br />
Be aware that the microphone array and head are placed above eachother, for visualisation reasons they are placed in front of eachother.
